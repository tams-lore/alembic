Welcome to TAMS Lore! Out of TAMS’ history, most of the stories have only been retained by administrators that have been here decades. The exception to this is found on an old website entitled TAMS Horror Stories. In an attempt to preserve the history of TAMS, I set up this website. If you can contribute, or if you find a dead link, please email <tams.lore@gmail.com>.

A lot of rules in the handbook have stories behind them. One of the Admins told us the laser pointer story at orientation. You could probably ask them for more stories.

Note that students were not supposed to go off campus (except for a few stores like Sack n’ Save) without TAMS permission and were not supposed to date non-TAMS students without written parental permission.

The main correction is that State schools can now take 75% from top 10%ers. The high schools now have more lenient graduation requirements, so dropping out isn’t quite as big of a deal. The class of 2016 only has 23 dropouts and a graduating class of 175. My favorite note in the passage is the fact that you can apply to other schools as a transfer student for schools that don’t ask for your high school transcript. I’ve never heard of the dropout cutoff date; it might not exist since I saw kids dropping out throughout first semester willingly.
