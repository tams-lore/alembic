IonTAMS was (and maybe still is idk) the online newspaper for TAMS. As if we actually needed a newspaper, it's a decent source of verifiable history on the program for the couple years ion actually spent trying to report TAMS happenings.

### DECA and All-Region: The Controversy

by Varada Salimath and Sarah Stephens · February 1, 2014

TAMS allows its students to gain tremendous exposure to math and science while maintaining their passions in music, art, and sports. But what happens when major competitions in these outside areas disqualify TAMS students?

Recently, many were taken aback when TAMS students were disqualified from participating in DECA, a marketing and entrepreneurship competition. Why did this happen? Current TAMS students were disqualified from these competitions primarily because some former students could not show up for the competitive events in years past. Because TAMS students are held to different academic standards and have a different lifestyle than typical high school students, it is often difficult for TAMS students to attend these events. “In fact, last year we were not able to go to state DECA because it conflicted with the Honors Chemistry Test,” says Helena Shi, current president of the TAMS Business Organization, the club that coordinated the DECA participation for TAMS students

Many students were understandably upset about the cancellation, such as junior Lucille Tang.

“I put in 5 hours of work for my DECA business proposal,” she says. “When I found out TAMS was disqualified, I was really upset that I had wasted all that time.”

What was surprising, however, was that this is not the first time TAMS students had been disqualified from competitions. The situation almost exactly mirrored that of TAMS’s disqualification last semester from participating in TMEA All-Region/All-State, a major state-level music competition.

Just weeks before the fall semester began, it was announced that TAMS was disqualified from All-Region. Naturally, many students were distraught. Moreover, for many, the decision to attend TAMS in part lay in their ability to continue their passions. According to Laura Pang, “My decision to come to TAMS would have been less enthusiastic had I know I couldn’t do All-Region.”

As junior, Michelle Yang, who made the All-Region and subsequent All-State orchestras last year describes it:

“The TMEA experience is a musically enhancing learning experience that you simply cannot gain by playing music by yourself. Knowing that a part of my musical education would be cut off and that I would miss out on something made me feel as if I had lost a precious opportunity.”

The cancellation of DECA has revived the disappointment of TAMS students like those who were planning to compete in All-Region, and the injustice felt by TAMS students due to these disqualifications is understandable. Not only do students feel like they have wasted their time, but many are disappointed that they are no longer able to pursue their passions through competitions. Because seniors and grand seniors simply had no other option than opt out of their competitions, current TAMS students are no longer allowed to take advantage of these opportunities either.

Although we may attend the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, by no means is everyone closeted away solely solving calculus problems and writing Siemens papers every waking hour. TAMS boasts countless state and nationally ranked competitors in various activities. While TAMS is a primarily academic environment, its students shouldn’t be barred from exploring their other talents. Should students be disqualified from these activities simply because they don’t attend a traditional high school?

### AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. DANE CROSSLEY

NOVEMBER 18, 2013 VARADA SALIMATH 2 2013-2014

The sun is rising, the birds are beginning to chirp, and over 200 TAMS students are dutifully making the trek from McConnell to Sage Hall for early morning biology. There are a number of experiences that unite a TAMS class, and perhaps the most significant of these is the shared experience of 8 AM biology. The stresses and the triumphs associated with making the great A in the course are as much a defining part of TAMS as anything else.

From the perspective of the class of 2015, it has been a particularly unique experience because of the new TAMS biology professor, Dr. Dane Crossley.  I recently had the opportunity to sit down with him and ask him about his own experience teaching TAMS students for the first time.

For Dr. Crossley, teaching TAMS students is “very different” from teaching regular UNT students. “I think TAMS students are more interested in knowing every detail, and they’re extremely bright. Usually in a population of students, you don’t have this extremely high concentration of really motivated people. This is something very unique, and it’s a fun challenge as a professor.”

Another challenge of being a professor is time management, Dr. Crossley says, which apparently doesn’t get any easier beyond college:  “You’re asked to do a lot. But, on the other hand I think some of the most rewarding things about being a professor include getting people excited about biology, and also finding unique data in your area of research.”

Specifically, Dr. Crossley’s area of research is developmental physiology and neurobiology in species such as alligators. “I’m a cardiovascular physiologist, so I look at how the environment affects not only adult cardiovascular function but also embryonic development in several species,” he explains, adding that the excitement of making a new discovery in one’s area of research never loses its thrill.

This fascination with biology started at a truly young age. “I’ve been a biologist since I was five,” he says. “I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. As a kid, I was always outside observing the tremendous biological diversity there, so it was obvious what it was I wanted to do.”

When asked about the number one key to success in his class, Dr. Crossley stresses “showing up and staying attentive and awake”. He emphasizes that this is most essential for this upper level of biology and application, along with reading the material prior to lecture.  “There are very few students who can study the textbook the night before an exam and do well,” he says. “There are some, but the overwhelming majority of students would do better if they committed wholeheartedly to actively listening in lecture. It gets really hard in upper level biology, and you have to dedicate all your energy to paying attention and understanding the material.”

Dr. Crossley explains that the integrated nature of biology is what makes it such a difficult subject for students. “A lot of people struggle with physics or chemistry, but in biology, you have physics and chemistry and life science all put together in a living system, and that can be very challenging to comprehend and analyze”, he says.

Finally, I asked Dr. Crossley if there were any words he would like to leave the TAMS Class of 2015 with. “You’re all in a unique position,” he said after some thought. “You’ve been given a tremendous opportunity because of your own talents. So you must take advantage of where you are because you all have the capacity to be exceptionally successful.”

### The Bio Bust

by Lucy Hao · September 25, 2013

The success of the junior class’s first bio test has been overshadowed by something most TAMSters know too well: cheating.

Wednesday morning started off normal, with the juniors waking early for their 8AM Biology class with Dr. Crossley, the new biology professor. After completing their first bio test Monday, most juniors were still proud and satisfied of their scores, which averaged an 88. But, as they trickled back into McConnell in an hour later, shock and disbelief flooded the halls.

“Most people were upset because we have no leeway for messing up now. People would have not cared if this test would be completely negated, but now there’s no room for error,” says one junior.

What happened? The juniors were told in class Wednesday morning that their first test would be the drop test for all juniors, meaning that the grades for the test would not count, due to academic dishonesty.

As this was the first bio test of the year, the juniors were understandably concerned and were looking for all the resources that they could get. With good intentions, one senior offered pictures of Burleson’s past test, and as Burleson was no longer teaching biology to the TAMS juniors, the senior who had the pictures and the juniors who wanted them did not see this as an act of academic dishonesty. Little did they know, however, that Dr. Crossley’s test would contain 17 out of 25 questions that were almost identical to those from Burleson’s.  Of the 14 students who originally were emailed the pictures, many scored 100s, and many more juniors outside of the 14 obtained the pictures from friends, giving some students an unfair lead.

“I’m confused why the senior would want the junior class to have an advantage. If he/she wanted the juniors to succeed, giving them answers would not have helped them in the long run,” says one junior.

“The senior knew that it was cheating; we were told specifically last year to not take pictures of the test. I feel so bad for the juniors, because they probably didn’t know,” says a senior.

“I was pretty upset with the senior because he never told us that it was illegal or even wrong but just acted like it was cool,” says one junior who was part of the 14, “Right now, I do not feel guilty because I was totally unaware that it was going to be the actual test and that the test was plagiarized. I did not rely on the test bank and studied really well for the test.”

For some, this news did not affect them, since the test would have already been their drop. But for others, who worked honestly to get the score that they did, this news was incredibly upsetting.

“I felt like 6 hours of my life had been wasted over the past week.  This was just the first test, and it wasn’t that hard. But, kids felt like they were too good for the test. It’s only going to get harder from here.”

“I know two juniors who made 100s, and they didn’t cheat. But now they’re afraid if they go into the next test and for some reason drop, he’ll think they cheated,” says the senior.

And finally, for many juniors, seniors, and admin, there is just disappointment.

“I don’t understand why [admin] aren’t doing anything,” one senior adds. “They must have alerted Crossley, but it’s not fair to punish the whole class. If this had happened to our class, the cheaters would have been kicked out. They’ve completely ruined relations with the new professor, and this is just the first test. TAMS’s reputation is ruined. I doubt Crossley will be back next year.”

As the juniors come to accept the fact that their scores, whether satisfactory or not, will be dropped, all are left wondering how this incident will affect the juniors and TAMS. Has the reputation of the junior class already been ruined, despite only being a month into school? Who was really at fault, the senior or the juniors? How will this affect TAMS’s relations with UNT faculty?

### How to Get a TAMS Girl

https://web.archive.org/web/20150330032719/http://iontams.com:80/2012/11/05/how-to-get-a-tams-girl/

by Naina Pati · November 5, 2012

Hey boys, now that homecoming is gone and girls aren’t taken anymore, you have the opportunity to get any girl you want. But, you don’t have an easy way out anymore (asking her to homecoming), so you’re going to need some help. Below are ten ways you can get a TAMS girl.

Step 1: Be taller than her.

Some of you guys get this one easy but others… don’t. Don’t worry! Here are some quick, simple tips wikiHOW has on how to get taller:

Get good sleep.
Eat right.
Practice good posture.
Cultivate confidence.
Visit a medical professional.
Step 2:Be outgoing!

I understand this can be really hard for some of you, especially those who have grown up listening to your parents say, “NO GIRLS, ONLY STUDY.”  However, now is the prime time to move past your fears.

Step 3: Be smart.

This is self explanatory. You’re at TAMS.

Step 4: Do cute and cheesy things for her.

This one’s REALLY important. If you do cute and cheesy things for a girl, she’s going to fall for you; however, it can’t be just small things like holding her hand. You have to do big things too. For example: buy her flowers, put little love notes in her pockets, wait for her after class, go on walks with her, etc.

Step 5: Play a musical instrument and/or sing.

Playing any musical instrument AND singing to a girl at the same time is almost the most romantic thing you can do. 68% of girls say they want their ideal guy to play the guitar and 39% say the piano. Wink, Wink.

Step 6: Be a Good Cook.

If you can’t cook, it’s okay! Cooking is in fact, as easy as 1-2-3-4. First, look up a recipe on Google. Google is your friend. Second, gather the ingredients. Third, follow the instructions and cook the food! Fourth, serve the food to your significant other.

Step 7: Ask her to study with you.

If you really like the girl and want to spend a lot of time with her outside of class, ask her to study with you. There are several ways to do this. For example, you could text her, Facebook message her, call her, or make a huge sign and put it in front of her door. She won’t be able to miss it.

Step 8: Be nice to her friends.

And be nice overall. Girls don’t like guys that are mean to them or to their friends.

Step 9:Take time out of your life to talk to her.

Lastly, take time to talk to her. How are you going to get her if she doesn’t know anything about you?

Step 10:Make the first move.

If she’s not texting you or talking to you, it’s probably not because she doesn’t want to, but because she doesn’t want to make the first move. So get a straw, suck it up and make the first move.

So now that you can get any girl you want, you should probably start picking. They aren’t going to wait for you forever.
