These stories are pretty classic. Final Fantasy VII was released in January 1997, so they're probably from around that time.

## The Original Content

The following is a collection of various stories and stuff that I've heard about/participated involving TAMS.  Some of it I have no idea about how true it is... but others I know damn good and well are true... but which is which is up to you to decide ;)

Um... oh, yeah, a caveat:  I tried to not put in people's names to protect the guilty... there's an exception but that's because it is a direct cut and paste from another person who noted something that needed to be changed.

Check out Lord Spurius' hit new song: TAMSters' Paradise!

NOTE: If you haven't played Final Fantasy VII, part of TAMSters' Paradise won't make much nor will #15 below.  Or, if you are currently playing it and haven't reached the point where Aeris dies and don't know that she does, you may not read the song or point #15, as it explicitly tells you that she dies... doh, I guess I just told you what happens to her... heh... oh well, now you can read everything here without having to worry about anything being spoilt!

#### 1. No sex.

In the original TAMS charter, around 1988 or so, TAMSters (the students in TAMS programme) were given full college student priveleges.  I.e. other than the age difference, there was to be no difference between the original students and regular University of North Texas students. 

Of course this was destined to fail (parents, go fig), so a few rules began being created.  If you look in recent editions of the TAMS Student Handbook, you'll see that there is a rule which explicitly states "No Sex."  Well, probably something closer to "No genital conduct."  Well, there used to not be that rule because the administration was scared to actually put a rule with the word "sex" or "genitals" or anything that remotely implied that, the same way many high schools refuse to pass out condoms to students (like some others do) because they think that it would promote sex -- put thoughts in the heads of the kids ya know.  

So.  They created several rules which beat around the bush (no ten inpunded... <dÃ¦monic grin>), and which still exist in addition to the more explicit rule:   Males may only be in females' rooms (and vice versa) during set visitation hours (which was like 1 hour a day weekdays, 2 hours on weekends); whilst members of both sex are in a given room, the door to said room must be fully open, the lights must be on, all people must be fully visible through the open door from the hall; all feet must be on the ground (i.e. no lying on beds, et alii), no two persons could be under a shared blanket, sheet, et cetera, and all occupants must be fully clothed.  They thought that would work. 

Let's think about this.  You have a congregation of the smartest teenagers (special importance on the fact that everyone in TAMS is ateenager. n. adolescent with raging hormones) in Texas.  They're going to find a way to bend rules to get what they want if at all possible.

And they did.  Two students (one male, one female) in a room.  Lights on.   Standing right in front the open door (yes, standing).  Pants and skirt on.   Pants unzipped, skirt up, but still on.  Two students having sex, standing fully visible, in no violation of TAMS policies.  An RA (Residence Assistant) happens to walk by and notices them there, but couldn't do anything because the students were following all rules.  A rule was quickly created to prevent similar occurrences, and it was made retrospective so that the students (who were fully within their rights at the time) still got into severe trouble from the administration after the event.

 

#### 2. Smile! You're on RC Car Camera!

Boys will be boys.  And there are around 200 boys in TAMS each year.  McConnell Hall is a three-story dormitory, co-ed by floor.  Third floor is boys, second floor is girls, and the first floor is divvied between the two genders with the main lobby and front desk between the entrances to the two section of the building.  And there is a single ventilation system throughout the entire building.

This fact was utilized one night.  A group of boys got a remote controlled race car.  They strapped a camcorder and a flashlight onto it.  They unscrewed the vent in their room and set it on its merry way, guiding it by the lights and camera which they set up a radio transmitter or something or other so that they could see through it on the television in their room.  (BTW, this is on the first floor, it'd be silly to do it on the third floor)  They then proceeded to drive it to the girls' side of the first floor and up to a vent in order to spy in on them, probably hoping to see them strip or something.

Stupid kids forgot to put a radio switch on the flashlight... the girls saw the light in the vent and had an RA check it out... ok, I mentioned they were stupid for leaving the flashlight on.  Did I bother to mention that the owner of the camcorder had one of those nifty little label makers?  And that he had put his name on the camcorder?  Well... you can guess the rest of the story.  Or if not, too damn bad.

 

#### 3. To sleep or not to sleep...

There's this thing called "Preview Day" at TAMS.  That's when all the prospective TAMSters (or a group of them at least, there are over a thousand prospective newbies each year) get a tour of UNT campus and of McConnell and the students showing them around lie their asses off trying to convince the wanna-be TAMSters that they still wanna be TAMSters.  Part of the tour of McConnell Hall is a show of various rooms in the Hall so the students and their parents can see what kind of living conditions are present.

The year before I went to TAMS, a friend of mine (my current roommate) (well, he wasn't a friend of mine at the time, I didn't know him then) and some of his friends had created a mini-computer lab on the third floor (mostly for gaming purposes).  There are two students per room generally.  Well, he, his roommate, and two of their friends who were roommates put all their computers into one of their rooms, and all the beds into the other room.

They signed the computer room up to be a room on the Hall tour, but not the bed room.   When the tour group came by, the leader hesitated a bit, and the four guys never looked up from their computer monitors.  A parent looked around the room and asked, "Where are the beds?"  "Beds?"  "Yeah, where do you sleep?"  "Sleep?"  The parent got really confused...   "But... how do you rest?"  "Rest?  We are resting."   All this time nobody turned from their screens.  The tour group stormed off completely confuzzled, and a rule was promptly made stating that there must be (exactly) two beds in all rooms at all times, and that no more than two students may be living in a given room.  That's just one of the rules that group of students had created...

 

#### 4. Smitty Strip Show

Another tale from a Preview Day.  Down on the first floor there are a few public facilities, the computer lab (the official one, not a student-fabricated one), Mac Cafe (a large parlour with an air hockey table, pool table, big-screen TV, and a lot of space for large meetings), and Smitty Study (a.k.a. Smutty, supposedly a quiet place to study and what not... my ass.  That's where people went to make out as much as allowed by TAMS policies during non-visitation hours, and it was almost always empty during visitation hours).

During one Preview Day, several students locked themselves in Smutty (there is a set of double (French?) doors through which you pass to get into the room).  While a tour group was passing by the window to the room, one of the girls in there started doing a provocative strip show (nothing very revealing to my knowledge, though who knows just how far she would have gone).  One of the women who works at the front desk noticed this and when she tried the door and found it locked, she rammed her way into it.  To this day, that door will not lock and barely can even stay shut.

 

#### 5. Duct Tape, the Miracle Cure

Another friend of mine (again, a year older than I and thus in the programme the year before me) for some reason or another got picked on a lot.  One instance in particular, I don't remember all the details, but he wound up duct-taped naked to the wall of the hall outside his room.  'Nuff said.  Oh... and the people that did it threatened to duct-tape him in a similar manner to the ceiling of Smutty.  Oh, and this was after they previously duct-taped him to his bed.

 

#### 6. Couch of Death

The Sleep of Death is Sleep the Same,

Save to Dream the Dream that Never Came.

Ok, so I like that quote from my poem ;)  Anyway.  Smutty Study has a couch in it.  Ok, it actually has several couches.  But there is one in particular that I'm talking about.  Another friend of mine (yet again from the year previous to mine, though he was in my "grade" when I went there, don't ask) had been awake for several days (ok, like two), and was rather... odd... odder than usual.  He spent three hours arguing with the couch he was sitting on about wheter or not he should go to sleep.  The couch one.  Erm... won.

Update (correction ?) from Lord Spurius:

Well, it all started after Nazar was awake for a long time in Smitty. He had been walking around and ended up near the comfy [sic]. Then, he turned and looked at the couch, and it spoke to him. "Sit down on me. I'm comfortable". Nazar looked at it, and told it, "No, if I sit there I'll fall asleep." The couch smiled and said, "No you won't. Trust me, sit down." So he sat down on the couch, still fighting to stay up. Then the couch said, "Don't worry, lay down on me. I won't let you fall asleep.". So, he layed down and fell asleep. To quote Nazar, "It lied to me! I trusted it, and it lied to me!"

#### 7. Jolt Cola

Same friend from above.  Everyone knows what Jolt Cola is, Â¿verdÃ¡d?  12 oz. can of cola with as much caffeine as an 8 oz. cup of coffee (which happens to be around 75 mg or so, over twice as much as Coke).  One friend of mine (not the one above, a much much scarier one) was highly addicted to caffeine, and drank like two Jolts a day.   After another sleepless binge the friend from 6. above needed to stay awake to study for the test he had at 8 the next morning, so he "borrowed" a Jolt from the other friend.  I got the hint as soon as he took one drink (I already knew he and caffeine didn't mix well).  The next day, he was called into our "Academic Advisor" office and was lectured for cocaine abuse... he apparently was running throughout the dorm at 3 in the a.m. making a general ruckus and acting "out of character."

 

#### 8. Runaway TAMSter on a two-way track...

One day, me and two friends of mine got bored â fear any time a TAMSter gets bored, no good will ever come of it.  We were wondering around the General Academic building and one of them said hey, let's play a joke on everyone back at the dorm... he and I were to go back to the dorm without the other friend and ask if anyone had seen her lately, she had run off when we weren't looking and we couldn't find her.

OK quick break for background check.  The reason this story would have been even partially feasible was that this particular girl had a peculiar habit of zoning out for no reason... then she'd spontaneously go somewhere.  One time we found her in a dorm cafeteria, another time sitting outside our dorm in the smoker's section (she hates smoking).  Once she zoned out whilst we were heading in a group to go eat and took off sprinting away in some random direction.  Now, I'm not an Olympic sprinter, but I do run much faster than she can.  But somehow or another she managed to run for about 3 blocks before I could catch her.  And she never remembered anything anytime she went to la-la land.

Well, back to the main story.  Then when I was a suitable distance away and they thought I couldn't hear them, they revamped the plan to include me on the prank as well... and when I wasn't looking they disappeared.  She got well away, but I caught him (they were hiding in the restrooms, and I just happened to need to use that facility...).  I realised what was going on, but played along.  He went to class then and I proceeded back to the dorm to get my books for my Biology Lab.

When I got back to the dorm, I decided to go on and play out the prank... I ran for the last block back to the dorm so I would be somewhat out of breath, and ran into Smutty (which is where the "Cocaine Addict" above was at the moment, and asked about whether she had come by, me and him lost her, yadda yadda yadda.  No?  Damn.   Well, I've got to go to class, let me know if you find anything out.

I got my books and went to class.  Twenty or so minutes into the 2-hour lab, the friend I told about her running off came, interrupted my teacher and took me out to talk about the occurence.  Apparently she hadn't returned, and there was a policeman who wanted to talk to me about the incident.  I blew it off and went back to class.   After returning to the dorm from class, my RA (who was 'on-call' at the moment) led me back into one of the offices where there was a policeman waiting for me.

After a bunch of bullshit that led to me telling him what I know and him flat out calling me a liar and telling me that I was "harbouring and abbetting a run-away" which apparently is a felony.  I laughed at him and left.  When I got back to the front desk another RA had some paper work he wanted me to check over, supposedly my personnel file for the police report.  I go by 'elim' instead of my real name John.  Well, I looked at the paper:

Elam, Kendell

SSN: <some num not mine>

DOB: <some date not my own>

SEX: FEMALE

HT:  5' 0"   (estimate)

WT:  105 LBS (estimate)

Compared to:

Horton, John

SSN: <Yeah, I'm gonna tell you>

DOB: <See above>

SEX: MALE

HT:  5' 4"

WT:  125 LBS

Not quite right, I laughed at the guy who pulled the record up about the time the cop came out of the room we talked in.  I laughed at him again and went to my room.   The "runaway" and the other conspirator showed up about 30 minutes or so before curfew to find that she was being looked for (they hadn't thought that I would go on and continue with the prank).  Her overprotective parents were notified (she wasn't allowed to be outside after dark), and become far more overprotectiver... to the extent that she was now to be in her room at all times that she was not in class or at meal (which she was allowed 3 1-hour time periods for such and for which they had all but given her the times she could eat).  Any other time, she was to be studying, and they had took the authority to call at any given moment (and they did very often, like at least 20 times a day, seriously)... if she wasn't in her room, she was to be removed from TAMS.  <WOW! That was a long one...>

 

#### 9. "[A] congregation of the smartest teenagers ... in Texas."

Remember I said that TAMS consisted of the smartest teens in Texas?  Well... I suppose that's not entirely true.  Or rather maybe some of these kids are exceptionally smart, but they're still just plain stupid.  We had an 11 p.m. curfew Sunday through Thursday and 1 the next a.m. on Friday and Saturday.  Sneaking out of the dorm after hours is supposedly grounds for automatic expulsion from the Academy.

One night (it was a Saturday I believe) at around 2 in the morning, a herd of TAMSter (20 or so) somehow managed to get out through a window or something (we were not allowed to open windows, and most windows in the building wouldn't open more than three or four inches).  Dumb asses walk in front of the main lobby.  The RA on duty sees them outside, recognises them, and runs out to intercept them.  He asks for some ID, and the dippleheads give them their UNT-TAMS IDs.

That's not really the scary part.  The scary part is that of the 20+ students that committed this unforgivable sin, only about a dozen actually got kicked out.

 

#### 10. More on "No Sex"

Ok, so this doesn't technically deal with sex directly, it is about PDA (Public Display of Affection).  Remember the rules above about the doors open, no mutual cover, yadda yadda yadda?  Well, naturally, after a while, rules start getting a little slack.  About mid-way through a semester, the RA's (who are the people who typically enforce the rules) become chummy with the students, and become more lenient.  Apparently, one of the Administrators (Dr. Sinclair, I'll tell more about him as the last horror story) caught a couple (consisting of a male and a female) in a room with dimmed (but on) lights asleep on the floor of the guy's room watching TV, with no cover, and were fully visible, everything was following rules precisely... there isn't one saying that a person can't sleep in someone else's room provided it was within visitation and all other rules were followed.

Sinclair threw a fit at this, and erased the rule about visitation (by now, 4 hours a day during the week, 7 on weekends)... as in, NOvisitation.   Period.  Ever again.  The next day all us students received  a letter stating "We are very disappointed ... blah blah blah ... this is a test period, no visitation for 2 weeks ... blah blah blah ... if we receive no complaints we may decide to reinstate visitation ... blah blah blah ... remember no complaints or it's permanent."

Needless to say this absolutely infuriated us.  I personally didn't care one way or the other about the no visitation, I never utilized it.  What got me was the fact that we were not allowed to voice our opinions against it.  Throughout the hall, no less than 5 hours after this note hit our boxes, countless signs popped up in the hall protesting.  My friends and I of course aided in this assault strictly because we had talents to offer their efforts, but I won't go into that.  Just to say that by the time the two week trial period had ended, the administrators were scared to death of an all-out uprising, which would have happened if they had tried to prolong the suspension.

 

#### 11. Dean Sinclair

I said I'd elaborate on Sinclair so here I am elaborating on it.  The original TAMS charter (through the end of my term at the Pen) provided for no "Dean" and was intended to be run by a group of administrators -- Dr. Sinclair, Dr. Donahue, Beth Black, and Donna Flemming (maybe some others or maybe some less, I never really cared that much).  Sinclair was an insane loon who insisted on pushing his Christian morals onto everyone (such as the above story about visitation and countless other times I'm not even going to try to go into).  And he has an ego the size of Alaska (or course as we learn with balloons, the bigger you stretch a container, due to the conservation of matter, the thinner the walls become, and thus much easier to *POP* which is more or less what caused the visitation bit).  None of the students like him.   But he just got the title of "Death of the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science."  Oh, wait, that should be "Dean" not "Death".   But I like my version better... it more suits his role.  (Fear, the "Death" part was an actual typo... I did not consciously intend to type that, but hey, I guess I did subconsciously.)

 

#### 12. "I now dub thee... men."

Three out of the four semesters I was in TAMS I had the same RA.  And he was very cool.  He let us run around doing pretty much anything we wanted, as long as we didn't disturb him.  And if we ever needed anything, his "door [was] always open... unless it's closed."

He was an artist... very talented also... at least when it dealt with the human body.   There was one time he needed a picture for a drawing he was doing and had me take it... a "closed door" event... it involved him being held by one of his girlfriends, both in near-nekkidness.  But that's another story, and that isn't going into this page... ;)

Towards the end of my second semester there, after the wing meeting (meeting whereby all the residents on a particular wing of the dorm were kept updated on current university / academy events, yadda yadda yadda), he invited all who wished to come into his room for a "rite of passage."  Most of the guys on our wing just went to their rooms or whatever (considering finals were coming up).  Well, maybe about half.   The rest of us went into his room where we proceeded to have a little 'party' â lotsa booze and lotsa women.  Only that the booze was IBC Root Beer and the only women he could get were from Penthouse magazines commendeered from one of the residents.  But hey... it was a very... bonding... experience...

 

#### 13. Party Poopers!

Every so often, the hall across the street from McConnell (Bruce Hall, the music majors' dorm, to quote a friend: "They're a bunch of phreaks!" <well, actually, we were the phreaks... Brucelings were just freaks>... an odd bunch) held a big dorm-wide party.  Really interesting... You could walk in and see people in all sorts of attire, or lack thereof.  Once there was a guy wearing a tophat and gogo boots.  Nothing else.  Lots of cross-dressing too.

Well, during a given party, a few TAMSters banded together and snuck through the crowd (much easier than you would think...) and into the basement, twisting and turning around all the groups making out (notice I didn't say couples) in the music rooms down there.  They discovered the breaker box.  Now like good little boys and girls... well, let's face it they weren't good little boys and girls... they flipped the switches.  All of them.  And this happened on not one â not two â but... well, I guess it was only two occasions.  But anyways, they now post guards to ensure nothing of the sort happens again... quite frankly I don't think it'll do very good...

 

#### 14. Enemy of the State

Once again, I emphasise that the students in TAMS are in general rather intelligent... or at least a few of us are.  Now.  Smart People + Computers = Felonies.   Lots and lots of felonies.

Well, I'll ignore the things everyone expects â piracy, et alii.  There a student who was playing around and stumbled upon some government organisation or other.   Out of curiosity, he started trying a few things, and then he was in the system.   Hacking a federal information server is not a happy thing.  Well, it is if you don't get caught.  But he did.  Kind of, I don't think HE got caught personally.  Rather, the FBI showed up a few hours later and started a menial investigation... nothing was seriously damaged or stolen or whatnot, so they weren't too interested.  But the government finally realised that this congregation of high-IQ students was a "threat to national security." 

Ever since, the email accounts given to TAMS students from the University are monitored for key words (I actually tried this... I sent an email to myself, just for a control <you always need a control in experiments> and then another containing a few choice words... the first I received, the second never went though... no error message from mail-dÃ¦mons, etc.).  To this day, I know of a few people who are monitored even with their non-UNT accounts.

 

#### 15. This Spud's for You

There's apparently this thing called a 'zip' gun.  I never really understood the concept fully... something about a zip gun being a gun with a cylindrical barrel or something (something which somewho excluded a projectile launcher with a square barrel).  The definition was stupid.  And so was this incident.

At TAMS, JETS (Junior Engineering and Technical Society) is a big club.   They did all kinds of "real world" and "practical" experiments, one of which involved seeing how aerosol pressurization and ignition forces blah blah blah... with a potato gun.  The went to some field somewhere and did their tests.   No problem.  Until they came back to the dorm and left the potato gun in the president's car half under a jacket.

A patrolling university cop saw the offending object and busted out the window on probable cause... he thought it was a pipe bomb.  I don't know why...   and I certainly don't know why he went ahead and broke the window but hey... TAMSters are smart, the UNT cops aren't.  Spiel happened, and they still justified their actions by saying that 'zip' guns are illegal on campus.  Covering their asses.

Well, the pres and vp of JETS got out of any legal and academic trouble caused by possession of an illegal firearm by coming to our weekly seminar (my class had to go "listen" <ok, so we just pretended to listen> to the administrators tell us how to survive in the "real" world) and preach to us about why what they did was wrong (funny considering they couldn't see what was wrong about anything they did and neither did any of us).  But hey, the admin were appeased, and that's what most of our existence of TAMS was... making the admin thinkthey got their way.

 

#### 16. AERIS DIES???

Final Fantasy VII hit TAMS pretty hard, and it was immediately very popular.  Now you see there's this character called Aeris in it who likewise became very popular among my friends.  During the course of the plotline though, Sephiroth sweeps down and kills Aeris, yadda yadda yadda she dies.

Well this didn't go over too well with my friends.  One, when he was playing, got into an absolutely pissy/withdrawn mood when he reached that point.   Another hadn't gotten quite that far when we started discussing the philosophical and sociological impact of FF7 on a MUD we were developing.  We were talking nonchalantly about this and that and casually mentioned Aeris' fate... about 5 minutes after which he looked up from the keyboard (we were in the same room) and asked nonconnectedly "Aeris dies?".  He then proceeded to shout over the MUD "AERIS DIES?!"  Men and their fascinations...

 

#### 17. Attaaaaack of the Brainless Dipplefarks!

OK so that title is just kinda silly, but I'm not thinking as crooked as I normally do, so just bear with me (or bare with me if you'd prefer).

One of the coolest RA's we had decided to do something silly and get married and go into the military *boggle*.  This is  the guy that instead of punishing the students for making a general ruckus, he aided them in their endeavour â once, in the computer lab in Story #3, another RA came in and gave the students playing Command & Conquer to be a bit more quieter (heh), something about being able to hear them on the other end of the building at 2 in the AM or something silly like that and told one of the occupants: "And tell your RA to be quite or I'm going to doc him!" (doc stands for document, i.e. make a formal complaint and request for repremandation) and the RA playing C&Cjust kinda waved at her.  Also, remember the bit about no sex?  Well, once he noted that the only reason he would doc one particular individual would be if said individual were nekkid, avidly screwing a member of the opposite sex, yadda yadda yadda â essentially breaking every rule in the book relating to PDA â and then he would come in, applaud, and THEN doc him...

Well, anyways, where was I.  Oh.  Well, he left, and they   had to hire a new RA.  The guy the picked was some kind of degenerate or something I swear... he was beyond white trash tye person.  I still haven't figured out how the hell the admin decided he would be a good role-model (which is part of the job of the RA's) to us.  He was just a general nuisance.  At one point like a week after he moved in, in order to apologise for doing something stupid, he brought one of my friends a beer so they could become buds or something (BTW, if I recall properly, alcohol was prohibited on campus, even in dorms of people over 21 and also in frathouses).   Funny... the next day he was trying to get some of us to help him move out... needless to say we just continued our AD&D session...

 



 

Um... that's all the stories I have at the moment.  Well at least the more legal ones.  Maybe I'll add some more if I can remember them, or if my friends who are currently in Hell tell me any more.  And the not so legal ones... I think I'll wait until after the statute of limitations nullifies them...

These stories are pretty classic. Final Fantasy VII was released in January 1997, so they're probably from around that time.



## The Original Content



The following is a collection of various stories and stuff that I've heard about/participated involving TAMS.  Some of it I have no idea about how true it is... but others I know damn good and well are true... but which is which is up to you to decide ;)

Um... oh, yeah, a caveat:  I tried to not put in people's names to protect the guilty... there's an exception but that's because it is a direct cut and paste from another person who noted something that needed to be changed.

Check out Lord Spurius' hit new song: TAMSters' Paradise!

NOTE: If you haven't played Final Fantasy VII, part of TAMSters' Paradise won't make much nor will #15 below.  Or, if you are currently playing it and haven't reached the point where Aeris dies and don't know that she does, you may not read the song or point #15, as it explicitly tells you that she dies... doh, I guess I just told you what happens to her... heh... oh well, now you can read everything here without having to worry about anything being spoilt!

#### 1. No sex.

In the original TAMS charter, around 1988 or so, TAMSters (the students in TAMS programme) were given full college student priveleges.  I.e. other than the age difference, there was to be no difference between the original students and regular University of North Texas students. 

Of course this was destined to fail (parents, go fig), so a few rules began being created.  If you look in recent editions of the TAMS Student Handbook, you'll see that there is a rule which explicitly states "No Sex."  Well, probably something closer to "No genital conduct."  Well, there used to not be that rule because the administration was scared to actually put a rule with the word "sex" or "genitals" or anything that remotely implied that, the same way many high schools refuse to pass out condoms to students (like some others do) because they think that it would promote sex -- put thoughts in the heads of the kids ya know.  

So.  They created several rules which beat around the bush (no ten inpunded... <dÃ¦monic grin>), and which still exist in addition to the more explicit rule:   Males may only be in females' rooms (and vice versa) during set visitation hours (which was like 1 hour a day weekdays, 2 hours on weekends); whilst members of both sex are in a given room, the door to said room must be fully open, the lights must be on, all people must be fully visible through the open door from the hall; all feet must be on the ground (i.e. no lying on beds, et alii), no two persons could be under a shared blanket, sheet, et cetera, and all occupants must be fully clothed.  They thought that would work. 

Let's think about this.  You have a congregation of the smartest teenagers (special importance on the fact that everyone in TAMS is ateenager. n. adolescent with raging hormones) in Texas.  They're going to find a way to bend rules to get what they want if at all possible.

And they did.  Two students (one male, one female) in a room.  Lights on.   Standing right in front the open door (yes, standing).  Pants and skirt on.   Pants unzipped, skirt up, but still on.  Two students having sex, standing fully visible, in no violation of TAMS policies.  An RA (Residence Assistant) happens to walk by and notices them there, but couldn't do anything because the students were following all rules.  A rule was quickly created to prevent similar occurrences, and it was made retrospective so that the students (who were fully within their rights at the time) still got into severe trouble from the administration after the event.

 

#### 2. Smile! You're on RC Car Camera!

Boys will be boys.  And there are around 200 boys in TAMS each year.  McConnell Hall is a three-story dormitory, co-ed by floor.  Third floor is boys, second floor is girls, and the first floor is divvied between the two genders with the main lobby and front desk between the entrances to the two section of the building.  And there is a single ventilation system throughout the entire building.

This fact was utilized one night.  A group of boys got a remote controlled race car.  They strapped a camcorder and a flashlight onto it.  They unscrewed the vent in their room and set it on its merry way, guiding it by the lights and camera which they set up a radio transmitter or something or other so that they could see through it on the television in their room.  (BTW, this is on the first floor, it'd be silly to do it on the third floor)  They then proceeded to drive it to the girls' side of the first floor and up to a vent in order to spy in on them, probably hoping to see them strip or something.

Stupid kids forgot to put a radio switch on the flashlight... the girls saw the light in the vent and had an RA check it out... ok, I mentioned they were stupid for leaving the flashlight on.  Did I bother to mention that the owner of the camcorder had one of those nifty little label makers?  And that he had put his name on the camcorder?  Well... you can guess the rest of the story.  Or if not, too damn bad.

 

#### 3. To sleep or not to sleep...

There's this thing called "Preview Day" at TAMS.  That's when all the prospective TAMSters (or a group of them at least, there are over a thousand prospective newbies each year) get a tour of UNT campus and of McConnell and the students showing them around lie their asses off trying to convince the wanna-be TAMSters that they still wanna be TAMSters.  Part of the tour of McConnell Hall is a show of various rooms in the Hall so the students and their parents can see what kind of living conditions are present.

The year before I went to TAMS, a friend of mine (my current roommate) (well, he wasn't a friend of mine at the time, I didn't know him then) and some of his friends had created a mini-computer lab on the third floor (mostly for gaming purposes).  There are two students per room generally.  Well, he, his roommate, and two of their friends who were roommates put all their computers into one of their rooms, and all the beds into the other room.

They signed the computer room up to be a room on the Hall tour, but not the bed room.   When the tour group came by, the leader hesitated a bit, and the four guys never looked up from their computer monitors.  A parent looked around the room and asked, "Where are the beds?"  "Beds?"  "Yeah, where do you sleep?"  "Sleep?"  The parent got really confused...   "But... how do you rest?"  "Rest?  We are resting."   All this time nobody turned from their screens.  The tour group stormed off completely confuzzled, and a rule was promptly made stating that there must be (exactly) two beds in all rooms at all times, and that no more than two students may be living in a given room.  That's just one of the rules that group of students had created...

 

#### 4. Smitty Strip Show

Another tale from a Preview Day.  Down on the first floor there are a few public facilities, the computer lab (the official one, not a student-fabricated one), Mac Cafe (a large parlour with an air hockey table, pool table, big-screen TV, and a lot of space for large meetings), and Smitty Study (a.k.a. Smutty, supposedly a quiet place to study and what not... my ass.  That's where people went to make out as much as allowed by TAMS policies during non-visitation hours, and it was almost always empty during visitation hours).

During one Preview Day, several students locked themselves in Smutty (there is a set of double (French?) doors through which you pass to get into the room).  While a tour group was passing by the window to the room, one of the girls in there started doing a provocative strip show (nothing very revealing to my knowledge, though who knows just how far she would have gone).  One of the women who works at the front desk noticed this and when she tried the door and found it locked, she rammed her way into it.  To this day, that door will not lock and barely can even stay shut.

 

#### 5. Duct Tape, the Miracle Cure

Another friend of mine (again, a year older than I and thus in the programme the year before me) for some reason or another got picked on a lot.  One instance in particular, I don't remember all the details, but he wound up duct-taped naked to the wall of the hall outside his room.  'Nuff said.  Oh... and the people that did it threatened to duct-tape him in a similar manner to the ceiling of Smutty.  Oh, and this was after they previously duct-taped him to his bed.

 

#### 6. Couch of Death

The Sleep of Death is Sleep the Same,

Save to Dream the Dream that Never Came.

Ok, so I like that quote from my poem ;)  Anyway.  Smutty Study has a couch in it.  Ok, it actually has several couches.  But there is one in particular that I'm talking about.  Another friend of mine (yet again from the year previous to mine, though he was in my "grade" when I went there, don't ask) had been awake for several days (ok, like two), and was rather... odd... odder than usual.  He spent three hours arguing with the couch he was sitting on about wheter or not he should go to sleep.  The couch one.  Erm... won.

Update (correction ?) from Lord Spurius:

Well, it all started after Nazar was awake for a long time in Smitty. He had been walking around and ended up near the comfy [sic]. Then, he turned and looked at the couch, and it spoke to him. "Sit down on me. I'm comfortable". Nazar looked at it, and told it, "No, if I sit there I'll fall asleep." The couch smiled and said, "No you won't. Trust me, sit down." So he sat down on the couch, still fighting to stay up. Then the couch said, "Don't worry, lay down on me. I won't let you fall asleep.". So, he layed down and fell asleep. To quote Nazar, "It lied to me! I trusted it, and it lied to me!"

#### 7. Jolt Cola

Same friend from above.  Everyone knows what Jolt Cola is, Â¿verdÃ¡d?  12 oz. can of cola with as much caffeine as an 8 oz. cup of coffee (which happens to be around 75 mg or so, over twice as much as Coke).  One friend of mine (not the one above, a much much scarier one) was highly addicted to caffeine, and drank like two Jolts a day.   After another sleepless binge the friend from 6. above needed to stay awake to study for the test he had at 8 the next morning, so he "borrowed" a Jolt from the other friend.  I got the hint as soon as he took one drink (I already knew he and caffeine didn't mix well).  The next day, he was called into our "Academic Advisor" office and was lectured for cocaine abuse... he apparently was running throughout the dorm at 3 in the a.m. making a general ruckus and acting "out of character."

 

#### 8. Runaway TAMSter on a two-way track...

One day, me and two friends of mine got bored â fear any time a TAMSter gets bored, no good will ever come of it.  We were wondering around the General Academic building and one of them said hey, let's play a joke on everyone back at the dorm... he and I were to go back to the dorm without the other friend and ask if anyone had seen her lately, she had run off when we weren't looking and we couldn't find her.

OK quick break for background check.  The reason this story would have been even partially feasible was that this particular girl had a peculiar habit of zoning out for no reason... then she'd spontaneously go somewhere.  One time we found her in a dorm cafeteria, another time sitting outside our dorm in the smoker's section (she hates smoking).  Once she zoned out whilst we were heading in a group to go eat and took off sprinting away in some random direction.  Now, I'm not an Olympic sprinter, but I do run much faster than she can.  But somehow or another she managed to run for about 3 blocks before I could catch her.  And she never remembered anything anytime she went to la-la land.

Well, back to the main story.  Then when I was a suitable distance away and they thought I couldn't hear them, they revamped the plan to include me on the prank as well... and when I wasn't looking they disappeared.  She got well away, but I caught him (they were hiding in the restrooms, and I just happened to need to use that facility...).  I realised what was going on, but played along.  He went to class then and I proceeded back to the dorm to get my books for my Biology Lab.

When I got back to the dorm, I decided to go on and play out the prank... I ran for the last block back to the dorm so I would be somewhat out of breath, and ran into Smutty (which is where the "Cocaine Addict" above was at the moment, and asked about whether she had come by, me and him lost her, yadda yadda yadda.  No?  Damn.   Well, I've got to go to class, let me know if you find anything out.

I got my books and went to class.  Twenty or so minutes into the 2-hour lab, the friend I told about her running off came, interrupted my teacher and took me out to talk about the occurence.  Apparently she hadn't returned, and there was a policeman who wanted to talk to me about the incident.  I blew it off and went back to class.   After returning to the dorm from class, my RA (who was 'on-call' at the moment) led me back into one of the offices where there was a policeman waiting for me.

After a bunch of bullshit that led to me telling him what I know and him flat out calling me a liar and telling me that I was "harbouring and abbetting a run-away" which apparently is a felony.  I laughed at him and left.  When I got back to the front desk another RA had some paper work he wanted me to check over, supposedly my personnel file for the police report.  I go by 'elim' instead of my real name John.  Well, I looked at the paper:

Elam, Kendell

SSN: <some num not mine>

DOB: <some date not my own>

SEX: FEMALE

HT:  5' 0"   (estimate)

WT:  105 LBS (estimate)

Compared to:

Horton, John

SSN: <Yeah, I'm gonna tell you>

DOB: <See above>

SEX: MALE

HT:  5' 4"

WT:  125 LBS

Not quite right, I laughed at the guy who pulled the record up about the time the cop came out of the room we talked in.  I laughed at him again and went to my room.   The "runaway" and the other conspirator showed up about 30 minutes or so before curfew to find that she was being looked for (they hadn't thought that I would go on and continue with the prank).  Her overprotective parents were notified (she wasn't allowed to be outside after dark), and become far more overprotectiver... to the extent that she was now to be in her room at all times that she was not in class or at meal (which she was allowed 3 1-hour time periods for such and for which they had all but given her the times she could eat).  Any other time, she was to be studying, and they had took the authority to call at any given moment (and they did very often, like at least 20 times a day, seriously)... if she wasn't in her room, she was to be removed from TAMS.  <WOW! That was a long one...>

 

#### 9. "[A] congregation of the smartest teenagers ... in Texas."

Remember I said that TAMS consisted of the smartest teens in Texas?  Well... I suppose that's not entirely true.  Or rather maybe some of these kids are exceptionally smart, but they're still just plain stupid.  We had an 11 p.m. curfew Sunday through Thursday and 1 the next a.m. on Friday and Saturday.  Sneaking out of the dorm after hours is supposedly grounds for automatic expulsion from the Academy.

One night (it was a Saturday I believe) at around 2 in the morning, a herd of TAMSter (20 or so) somehow managed to get out through a window or something (we were not allowed to open windows, and most windows in the building wouldn't open more than three or four inches).  Dumb asses walk in front of the main lobby.  The RA on duty sees them outside, recognises them, and runs out to intercept them.  He asks for some ID, and the dippleheads give them their UNT-TAMS IDs.

That's not really the scary part.  The scary part is that of the 20+ students that committed this unforgivable sin, only about a dozen actually got kicked out.

 

#### 10. More on "No Sex"

Ok, so this doesn't technically deal with sex directly, it is about PDA (Public Display of Affection).  Remember the rules above about the doors open, no mutual cover, yadda yadda yadda?  Well, naturally, after a while, rules start getting a little slack.  About mid-way through a semester, the RA's (who are the people who typically enforce the rules) become chummy with the students, and become more lenient.  Apparently, one of the Administrators (Dr. Sinclair, I'll tell more about him as the last horror story) caught a couple (consisting of a male and a female) in a room with dimmed (but on) lights asleep on the floor of the guy's room watching TV, with no cover, and were fully visible, everything was following rules precisely... there isn't one saying that a person can't sleep in someone else's room provided it was within visitation and all other rules were followed.

Sinclair threw a fit at this, and erased the rule about visitation (by now, 4 hours a day during the week, 7 on weekends)... as in, NOvisitation.   Period.  Ever again.  The next day all us students received  a letter stating "We are very disappointed ... blah blah blah ... this is a test period, no visitation for 2 weeks ... blah blah blah ... if we receive no complaints we may decide to reinstate visitation ... blah blah blah ... remember no complaints or it's permanent."

Needless to say this absolutely infuriated us.  I personally didn't care one way or the other about the no visitation, I never utilized it.  What got me was the fact that we were not allowed to voice our opinions against it.  Throughout the hall, no less than 5 hours after this note hit our boxes, countless signs popped up in the hall protesting.  My friends and I of course aided in this assault strictly because we had talents to offer their efforts, but I won't go into that.  Just to say that by the time the two week trial period had ended, the administrators were scared to death of an all-out uprising, which would have happened if they had tried to prolong the suspension.

 

#### 11. Dean Sinclair

I said I'd elaborate on Sinclair so here I am elaborating on it.  The original TAMS charter (through the end of my term at the Pen) provided for no "Dean" and was intended to be run by a group of administrators -- Dr. Sinclair, Dr. Donahue, Beth Black, and Donna Flemming (maybe some others or maybe some less, I never really cared that much).  Sinclair was an insane loon who insisted on pushing his Christian morals onto everyone (such as the above story about visitation and countless other times I'm not even going to try to go into).  And he has an ego the size of Alaska (or course as we learn with balloons, the bigger you stretch a container, due to the conservation of matter, the thinner the walls become, and thus much easier to *POP* which is more or less what caused the visitation bit).  None of the students like him.   But he just got the title of "Death of the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science."  Oh, wait, that should be "Dean" not "Death".   But I like my version better... it more suits his role.  (Fear, the "Death" part was an actual typo... I did not consciously intend to type that, but hey, I guess I did subconsciously.)

 

#### 12. "I now dub thee... men."

Three out of the four semesters I was in TAMS I had the same RA.  And he was very cool.  He let us run around doing pretty much anything we wanted, as long as we didn't disturb him.  And if we ever needed anything, his "door [was] always open... unless it's closed."

He was an artist... very talented also... at least when it dealt with the human body.   There was one time he needed a picture for a drawing he was doing and had me take it... a "closed door" event... it involved him being held by one of his girlfriends, both in near-nekkidness.  But that's another story, and that isn't going into this page... ;)

Towards the end of my second semester there, after the wing meeting (meeting whereby all the residents on a particular wing of the dorm were kept updated on current university / academy events, yadda yadda yadda), he invited all who wished to come into his room for a "rite of passage."  Most of the guys on our wing just went to their rooms or whatever (considering finals were coming up).  Well, maybe about half.   The rest of us went into his room where we proceeded to have a little 'party' â lotsa booze and lotsa women.  Only that the booze was IBC Root Beer and the only women he could get were from Penthouse magazines commendeered from one of the residents.  But hey... it was a very... bonding... experience...

 

#### 13. Party Poopers!

Every so often, the hall across the street from McConnell (Bruce Hall, the music majors' dorm, to quote a friend: "They're a bunch of phreaks!" <well, actually, we were the phreaks... Brucelings were just freaks>... an odd bunch) held a big dorm-wide party.  Really interesting... You could walk in and see people in all sorts of attire, or lack thereof.  Once there was a guy wearing a tophat and gogo boots.  Nothing else.  Lots of cross-dressing too.

Well, during a given party, a few TAMSters banded together and snuck through the crowd (much easier than you would think...) and into the basement, twisting and turning around all the groups making out (notice I didn't say couples) in the music rooms down there.  They discovered the breaker box.  Now like good little boys and girls... well, let's face it they weren't good little boys and girls... they flipped the switches.  All of them.  And this happened on not one â not two â but... well, I guess it was only two occasions.  But anyways, they now post guards to ensure nothing of the sort happens again... quite frankly I don't think it'll do very good...

 

#### 14. Enemy of the State

Once again, I emphasise that the students in TAMS are in general rather intelligent... or at least a few of us are.  Now.  Smart People + Computers = Felonies.   Lots and lots of felonies.

Well, I'll ignore the things everyone expects â piracy, et alii.  There a student who was playing around and stumbled upon some government organisation or other.   Out of curiosity, he started trying a few things, and then he was in the system.   Hacking a federal information server is not a happy thing.  Well, it is if you don't get caught.  But he did.  Kind of, I don't think HE got caught personally.  Rather, the FBI showed up a few hours later and started a menial investigation... nothing was seriously damaged or stolen or whatnot, so they weren't too interested.  But the government finally realised that this congregation of high-IQ students was a "threat to national security." 

Ever since, the email accounts given to TAMS students from the University are monitored for key words (I actually tried this... I sent an email to myself, just for a control <you always need a control in experiments> and then another containing a few choice words... the first I received, the second never went though... no error message from mail-dÃ¦mons, etc.).  To this day, I know of a few people who are monitored even with their non-UNT accounts.

 

#### 15. This Spud's for You

There's apparently this thing called a 'zip' gun.  I never really understood the concept fully... something about a zip gun being a gun with a cylindrical barrel or something (something which somewho excluded a projectile launcher with a square barrel).  The definition was stupid.  And so was this incident.

At TAMS, JETS (Junior Engineering and Technical Society) is a big club.   They did all kinds of "real world" and "practical" experiments, one of which involved seeing how aerosol pressurization and ignition forces blah blah blah... with a potato gun.  The went to some field somewhere and did their tests.   No problem.  Until they came back to the dorm and left the potato gun in the president's car half under a jacket.

A patrolling university cop saw the offending object and busted out the window on probable cause... he thought it was a pipe bomb.  I don't know why...   and I certainly don't know why he went ahead and broke the window but hey... TAMSters are smart, the UNT cops aren't.  Spiel happened, and they still justified their actions by saying that 'zip' guns are illegal on campus.  Covering their asses.

Well, the pres and vp of JETS got out of any legal and academic trouble caused by possession of an illegal firearm by coming to our weekly seminar (my class had to go "listen" <ok, so we just pretended to listen> to the administrators tell us how to survive in the "real" world) and preach to us about why what they did was wrong (funny considering they couldn't see what was wrong about anything they did and neither did any of us).  But hey, the admin were appeased, and that's what most of our existence of TAMS was... making the admin thinkthey got their way.

 

#### 16. AERIS DIES???

Final Fantasy VII hit TAMS pretty hard, and it was immediately very popular.  Now you see there's this character called Aeris in it who likewise became very popular among my friends.  During the course of the plotline though, Sephiroth sweeps down and kills Aeris, yadda yadda yadda she dies.

Well this didn't go over too well with my friends.  One, when he was playing, got into an absolutely pissy/withdrawn mood when he reached that point.   Another hadn't gotten quite that far when we started discussing the philosophical and sociological impact of FF7 on a MUD we were developing.  We were talking nonchalantly about this and that and casually mentioned Aeris' fate... about 5 minutes after which he looked up from the keyboard (we were in the same room) and asked nonconnectedly "Aeris dies?".  He then proceeded to shout over the MUD "AERIS DIES?!"  Men and their fascinations...

 

#### 17. Attaaaaack of the Brainless Dipplefarks!

OK so that title is just kinda silly, but I'm not thinking as crooked as I normally do, so just bear with me (or bare with me if you'd prefer).

One of the coolest RA's we had decided to do something silly and get married and go into the military *boggle*.  This is  the guy that instead of punishing the students for making a general ruckus, he aided them in their endeavour â once, in the computer lab in Story #3, another RA came in and gave the students playing Command & Conquer to be a bit more quieter (heh), something about being able to hear them on the other end of the building at 2 in the AM or something silly like that and told one of the occupants: "And tell your RA to be quite or I'm going to doc him!" (doc stands for document, i.e. make a formal complaint and request for repremandation) and the RA playing C&Cjust kinda waved at her.  Also, remember the bit about no sex?  Well, once he noted that the only reason he would doc one particular individual would be if said individual were nekkid, avidly screwing a member of the opposite sex, yadda yadda yadda â essentially breaking every rule in the book relating to PDA â and then he would come in, applaud, and THEN doc him...

Well, anyways, where was I.  Oh.  Well, he left, and they   had to hire a new RA.  The guy the picked was some kind of degenerate or something I swear... he was beyond white trash tye person.  I still haven't figured out how the hell the admin decided he would be a good role-model (which is part of the job of the RA's) to us.  He was just a general nuisance.  At one point like a week after he moved in, in order to apologise for doing something stupid, he brought one of my friends a beer so they could become buds or something (BTW, if I recall properly, alcohol was prohibited on campus, even in dorms of people over 21 and also in frathouses).   Funny... the next day he was trying to get some of us to help him move out... needless to say we just continued our AD&D session...

 



 

Um... that's all the stories I have at the moment.  Well at least the more legal ones.  Maybe I'll add some more if I can remember them, or if my friends who are currently in Hell tell me any more.  And the not so legal ones... I think I'll wait until after the statute of limitations nullifies them...



The following is a collection of various stories and stuff that I've heard about/participated involving TAMS.  Some of it I have no idea about how true it is... but others I know damn good and well are true... but which is which is up to you to decide ;)
Um... oh, yeah, a caveat:  I tried to not put in people's names to protect the guilty... there's an exception but that's because it is a direct cut and paste from another person who noted something that needed to be changed.
Check out Lord Spurius' hit new song: TAMSters' Paradise!
NOTE: If you haven't played Final Fantasy VII, part of TAMSters' Paradise won't make much nor will #15 below.  Or, if you are currently playing it and haven't reached the point where Aeris dies and don't know that she does, you may not read the song or point #15, as it explicitly tells you that she dies... doh, I guess I just told you what happens to her... heh... oh well, now you can read everything here without having to worry about anything being spoilt!

#### 1. No sex.
In the original TAMS charter, around 1988 or so, TAMSters (the students in TAMS programme) were given full college student priveleges.  I.e. other than the age difference, there was to be no difference between the original students and regular University of North Texas students. 
Of course this was destined to fail (parents, go fig), so a few rules began being created.  If you look in recent editions of the TAMS Student Handbook, you'll see that there is a rule which explicitly states "No Sex."  Well, probably something closer to "No genital conduct."  Well, there used to not be that rule because the administration was scared to actually put a rule with the word "sex" or "genitals" or anything that remotely implied that, the same way many high schools refuse to pass out condoms to students (like some others do) because they think that it would promote sex -- put thoughts in the heads of the kids ya know.  
So.  They created several rules which beat around the bush (no ten inpunded... <dÃ¦monic grin>), and which still exist in addition to the more explicit rule:   Males may only be in females' rooms (and vice versa) during set visitation hours (which was like 1 hour a day weekdays, 2 hours on weekends); whilst members of both sex are in a given room, the door to said room must be fully open, the lights must be on, all people must be fully visible through the open door from the hall; all feet must be on the ground (i.e. no lying on beds, et alii), no two persons could be under a shared blanket, sheet, et cetera, and all occupants must be fully clothed.  They thought that would work. 
Let's think about this.  You have a congregation of the smartest teenagers (special importance on the fact that everyone in TAMS is ateenager. n. adolescent with raging hormones) in Texas.  They're going to find a way to bend rules to get what they want if at all possible.
And they did.  Two students (one male, one female) in a room.  Lights on.   Standing right in front the open door (yes, standing).  Pants and skirt on.   Pants unzipped, skirt up, but still on.  Two students having sex, standing fully visible, in no violation of TAMS policies.  An RA (Residence Assistant) happens to walk by and notices them there, but couldn't do anything because the students were following all rules.  A rule was quickly created to prevent similar occurrences, and it was made retrospective so that the students (who were fully within their rights at the time) still got into severe trouble from the administration after the event.
 
#### 2. Smile! You're on RC Car Camera!
Boys will be boys.  And there are around 200 boys in TAMS each year.  McConnell Hall is a three-story dormitory, co-ed by floor.  Third floor is boys, second floor is girls, and the first floor is divvied between the two genders with the main lobby and front desk between the entrances to the two section of the building.  And there is a single ventilation system throughout the entire building.
This fact was utilized one night.  A group of boys got a remote controlled race car.  They strapped a camcorder and a flashlight onto it.  They unscrewed the vent in their room and set it on its merry way, guiding it by the lights and camera which they set up a radio transmitter or something or other so that they could see through it on the television in their room.  (BTW, this is on the first floor, it'd be silly to do it on the third floor)  They then proceeded to drive it to the girls' side of the first floor and up to a vent in order to spy in on them, probably hoping to see them strip or something.
Stupid kids forgot to put a radio switch on the flashlight... the girls saw the light in the vent and had an RA check it out... ok, I mentioned they were stupid for leaving the flashlight on.  Did I bother to mention that the owner of the camcorder had one of those nifty little label makers?  And that he had put his name on the camcorder?  Well... you can guess the rest of the story.  Or if not, too damn bad.
 
#### 3. To sleep or not to sleep...
There's this thing called "Preview Day" at TAMS.  That's when all the prospective TAMSters (or a group of them at least, there are over a thousand prospective newbies each year) get a tour of UNT campus and of McConnell and the students showing them around lie their asses off trying to convince the wanna-be TAMSters that they still wanna be TAMSters.  Part of the tour of McConnell Hall is a show of various rooms in the Hall so the students and their parents can see what kind of living conditions are present.
The year before I went to TAMS, a friend of mine (my current roommate) (well, he wasn't a friend of mine at the time, I didn't know him then) and some of his friends had created a mini-computer lab on the third floor (mostly for gaming purposes).  There are two students per room generally.  Well, he, his roommate, and two of their friends who were roommates put all their computers into one of their rooms, and all the beds into the other room.
They signed the computer room up to be a room on the Hall tour, but not the bed room.   When the tour group came by, the leader hesitated a bit, and the four guys never looked up from their computer monitors.  A parent looked around the room and asked, "Where are the beds?"  "Beds?"  "Yeah, where do you sleep?"  "Sleep?"  The parent got really confused...   "But... how do you rest?"  "Rest?  We are resting."   All this time nobody turned from their screens.  The tour group stormed off completely confuzzled, and a rule was promptly made stating that there must be (exactly) two beds in all rooms at all times, and that no more than two students may be living in a given room.  That's just one of the rules that group of students had created...
 
#### 4. Smitty Strip Show
Another tale from a Preview Day.  Down on the first floor there are a few public facilities, the computer lab (the official one, not a student-fabricated one), Mac Cafe (a large parlour with an air hockey table, pool table, big-screen TV, and a lot of space for large meetings), and Smitty Study (a.k.a. Smutty, supposedly a quiet place to study and what not... my ass.  That's where people went to make out as much as allowed by TAMS policies during non-visitation hours, and it was almost always empty during visitation hours).
During one Preview Day, several students locked themselves in Smutty (there is a set of double (French?) doors through which you pass to get into the room).  While a tour group was passing by the window to the room, one of the girls in there started doing a provocative strip show (nothing very revealing to my knowledge, though who knows just how far she would have gone).  One of the women who works at the front desk noticed this and when she tried the door and found it locked, she rammed her way into it.  To this day, that door will not lock and barely can even stay shut.
 
#### 5. Duct Tape, the Miracle Cure
Another friend of mine (again, a year older than I and thus in the programme the year before me) for some reason or another got picked on a lot.  One instance in particular, I don't remember all the details, but he wound up duct-taped naked to the wall of the hall outside his room.  'Nuff said.  Oh... and the people that did it threatened to duct-tape him in a similar manner to the ceiling of Smutty.  Oh, and this was after they previously duct-taped him to his bed.
 
#### 6. Couch of Death
The Sleep of Death is Sleep the Same,
Save to Dream the Dream that Never Came.
Ok, so I like that quote from my poem ;)  Anyway.  Smutty Study has a couch in it.  Ok, it actually has several couches.  But there is one in particular that I'm talking about.  Another friend of mine (yet again from the year previous to mine, though he was in my "grade" when I went there, don't ask) had been awake for several days (ok, like two), and was rather... odd... odder than usual.  He spent three hours arguing with the couch he was sitting on about wheter or not he should go to sleep.  The couch one.  Erm... won.
Update (correction ?) from Lord Spurius:
Well, it all started after Nazar was awake for a long time in Smitty. He had been walking around and ended up near the comfy [sic]. Then, he turned and looked at the couch, and it spoke to him. "Sit down on me. I'm comfortable". Nazar looked at it, and told it, "No, if I sit there I'll fall asleep." The couch smiled and said, "No you won't. Trust me, sit down." So he sat down on the couch, still fighting to stay up. Then the couch said, "Don't worry, lay down on me. I won't let you fall asleep.". So, he layed down and fell asleep. To quote Nazar, "It lied to me! I trusted it, and it lied to me!"

#### 7. Jolt Cola
Same friend from above.  Everyone knows what Jolt Cola is, Â¿verdÃ¡d?  12 oz. can of cola with as much caffeine as an 8 oz. cup of coffee (which happens to be around 75 mg or so, over twice as much as Coke).  One friend of mine (not the one above, a much much scarier one) was highly addicted to caffeine, and drank like two Jolts a day.   After another sleepless binge the friend from 6. above needed to stay awake to study for the test he had at 8 the next morning, so he "borrowed" a Jolt from the other friend.  I got the hint as soon as he took one drink (I already knew he and caffeine didn't mix well).  The next day, he was called into our "Academic Advisor" office and was lectured for cocaine abuse... he apparently was running throughout the dorm at 3 in the a.m. making a general ruckus and acting "out of character."
 
#### 8. Runaway TAMSter on a two-way track...
One day, me and two friends of mine got bored â fear any time a TAMSter gets bored, no good will ever come of it.  We were wondering around the General Academic building and one of them said hey, let's play a joke on everyone back at the dorm... he and I were to go back to the dorm without the other friend and ask if anyone had seen her lately, she had run off when we weren't looking and we couldn't find her.
OK quick break for background check.  The reason this story would have been even partially feasible was that this particular girl had a peculiar habit of zoning out for no reason... then she'd spontaneously go somewhere.  One time we found her in a dorm cafeteria, another time sitting outside our dorm in the smoker's section (she hates smoking).  Once she zoned out whilst we were heading in a group to go eat and took off sprinting away in some random direction.  Now, I'm not an Olympic sprinter, but I do run much faster than she can.  But somehow or another she managed to run for about 3 blocks before I could catch her.  And she never remembered anything anytime she went to la-la land.
Well, back to the main story.  Then when I was a suitable distance away and they thought I couldn't hear them, they revamped the plan to include me on the prank as well... and when I wasn't looking they disappeared.  She got well away, but I caught him (they were hiding in the restrooms, and I just happened to need to use that facility...).  I realised what was going on, but played along.  He went to class then and I proceeded back to the dorm to get my books for my Biology Lab.
When I got back to the dorm, I decided to go on and play out the prank... I ran for the last block back to the dorm so I would be somewhat out of breath, and ran into Smutty (which is where the "Cocaine Addict" above was at the moment, and asked about whether she had come by, me and him lost her, yadda yadda yadda.  No?  Damn.   Well, I've got to go to class, let me know if you find anything out.
I got my books and went to class.  Twenty or so minutes into the 2-hour lab, the friend I told about her running off came, interrupted my teacher and took me out to talk about the occurence.  Apparently she hadn't returned, and there was a policeman who wanted to talk to me about the incident.  I blew it off and went back to class.   After returning to the dorm from class, my RA (who was 'on-call' at the moment) led me back into one of the offices where there was a policeman waiting for me.
After a bunch of bullshit that led to me telling him what I know and him flat out calling me a liar and telling me that I was "harbouring and abbetting a run-away" which apparently is a felony.  I laughed at him and left.  When I got back to the front desk another RA had some paper work he wanted me to check over, supposedly my personnel file for the police report.  I go by 'elim' instead of my real name John.  Well, I looked at the paper:
Elam, Kendell
SSN: <some num not mine>
DOB: <some date not my own>
SEX: FEMALE
HT:  5' 0"   (estimate)
WT:  105 LBS (estimate)
Compared to:
Horton, John
SSN: <Yeah, I'm gonna tell you>
DOB: <See above>
SEX: MALE
HT:  5' 4"
WT:  125 LBS
Not quite right, I laughed at the guy who pulled the record up about the time the cop came out of the room we talked in.  I laughed at him again and went to my room.   The "runaway" and the other conspirator showed up about 30 minutes or so before curfew to find that she was being looked for (they hadn't thought that I would go on and continue with the prank).  Her overprotective parents were notified (she wasn't allowed to be outside after dark), and become far more overprotectiver... to the extent that she was now to be in her room at all times that she was not in class or at meal (which she was allowed 3 1-hour time periods for such and for which they had all but given her the times she could eat).  Any other time, she was to be studying, and they had took the authority to call at any given moment (and they did very often, like at least 20 times a day, seriously)... if she wasn't in her room, she was to be removed from TAMS.  <WOW! That was a long one...>
 
#### 9. "[A] congregation of the smartest teenagers ... in Texas."
Remember I said that TAMS consisted of the smartest teens in Texas?  Well... I suppose that's not entirely true.  Or rather maybe some of these kids are exceptionally smart, but they're still just plain stupid.  We had an 11 p.m. curfew Sunday through Thursday and 1 the next a.m. on Friday and Saturday.  Sneaking out of the dorm after hours is supposedly grounds for automatic expulsion from the Academy.
One night (it was a Saturday I believe) at around 2 in the morning, a herd of TAMSter (20 or so) somehow managed to get out through a window or something (we were not allowed to open windows, and most windows in the building wouldn't open more than three or four inches).  Dumb asses walk in front of the main lobby.  The RA on duty sees them outside, recognises them, and runs out to intercept them.  He asks for some ID, and the dippleheads give them their UNT-TAMS IDs.
That's not really the scary part.  The scary part is that of the 20+ students that committed this unforgivable sin, only about a dozen actually got kicked out.
 
#### 10. More on "No Sex"
Ok, so this doesn't technically deal with sex directly, it is about PDA (Public Display of Affection).  Remember the rules above about the doors open, no mutual cover, yadda yadda yadda?  Well, naturally, after a while, rules start getting a little slack.  About mid-way through a semester, the RA's (who are the people who typically enforce the rules) become chummy with the students, and become more lenient.  Apparently, one of the Administrators (Dr. Sinclair, I'll tell more about him as the last horror story) caught a couple (consisting of a male and a female) in a room with dimmed (but on) lights asleep on the floor of the guy's room watching TV, with no cover, and were fully visible, everything was following rules precisely... there isn't one saying that a person can't sleep in someone else's room provided it was within visitation and all other rules were followed.
Sinclair threw a fit at this, and erased the rule about visitation (by now, 4 hours a day during the week, 7 on weekends)... as in, NOvisitation.   Period.  Ever again.  The next day all us students received  a letter stating "We are very disappointed ... blah blah blah ... this is a test period, no visitation for 2 weeks ... blah blah blah ... if we receive no complaints we may decide to reinstate visitation ... blah blah blah ... remember no complaints or it's permanent."
Needless to say this absolutely infuriated us.  I personally didn't care one way or the other about the no visitation, I never utilized it.  What got me was the fact that we were not allowed to voice our opinions against it.  Throughout the hall, no less than 5 hours after this note hit our boxes, countless signs popped up in the hall protesting.  My friends and I of course aided in this assault strictly because we had talents to offer their efforts, but I won't go into that.  Just to say that by the time the two week trial period had ended, the administrators were scared to death of an all-out uprising, which would have happened if they had tried to prolong the suspension.
 
#### 11. Dean Sinclair
I said I'd elaborate on Sinclair so here I am elaborating on it.  The original TAMS charter (through the end of my term at the Pen) provided for no "Dean" and was intended to be run by a group of administrators -- Dr. Sinclair, Dr. Donahue, Beth Black, and Donna Flemming (maybe some others or maybe some less, I never really cared that much).  Sinclair was an insane loon who insisted on pushing his Christian morals onto everyone (such as the above story about visitation and countless other times I'm not even going to try to go into).  And he has an ego the size of Alaska (or course as we learn with balloons, the bigger you stretch a container, due to the conservation of matter, the thinner the walls become, and thus much easier to *POP* which is more or less what caused the visitation bit).  None of the students like him.   But he just got the title of "Death of the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science."  Oh, wait, that should be "Dean" not "Death".   But I like my version better... it more suits his role.  (Fear, the "Death" part was an actual typo... I did not consciously intend to type that, but hey, I guess I did subconsciously.)
 
#### 12. "I now dub thee... men."
Three out of the four semesters I was in TAMS I had the same RA.  And he was very cool.  He let us run around doing pretty much anything we wanted, as long as we didn't disturb him.  And if we ever needed anything, his "door [was] always open... unless it's closed."
He was an artist... very talented also... at least when it dealt with the human body.   There was one time he needed a picture for a drawing he was doing and had me take it... a "closed door" event... it involved him being held by one of his girlfriends, both in near-nekkidness.  But that's another story, and that isn't going into this page... ;)
Towards the end of my second semester there, after the wing meeting (meeting whereby all the residents on a particular wing of the dorm were kept updated on current university / academy events, yadda yadda yadda), he invited all who wished to come into his room for a "rite of passage."  Most of the guys on our wing just went to their rooms or whatever (considering finals were coming up).  Well, maybe about half.   The rest of us went into his room where we proceeded to have a little 'party' â lotsa booze and lotsa women.  Only that the booze was IBC Root Beer and the only women he could get were from Penthouse magazines commendeered from one of the residents.  But hey... it was a very... bonding... experience...
 
#### 13. Party Poopers!
Every so often, the hall across the street from McConnell (Bruce Hall, the music majors' dorm, to quote a friend: "They're a bunch of phreaks!" <well, actually, we were the phreaks... Brucelings were just freaks>... an odd bunch) held a big dorm-wide party.  Really interesting... You could walk in and see people in all sorts of attire, or lack thereof.  Once there was a guy wearing a tophat and gogo boots.  Nothing else.  Lots of cross-dressing too.
Well, during a given party, a few TAMSters banded together and snuck through the crowd (much easier than you would think...) and into the basement, twisting and turning around all the groups making out (notice I didn't say couples) in the music rooms down there.  They discovered the breaker box.  Now like good little boys and girls... well, let's face it they weren't good little boys and girls... they flipped the switches.  All of them.  And this happened on not one â not two â but... well, I guess it was only two occasions.  But anyways, they now post guards to ensure nothing of the sort happens again... quite frankly I don't think it'll do very good...
 
#### 14. Enemy of the State
Once again, I emphasise that the students in TAMS are in general rather intelligent... or at least a few of us are.  Now.  Smart People + Computers = Felonies.   Lots and lots of felonies.
Well, I'll ignore the things everyone expects â piracy, et alii.  There a student who was playing around and stumbled upon some government organisation or other.   Out of curiosity, he started trying a few things, and then he was in the system.   Hacking a federal information server is not a happy thing.  Well, it is if you don't get caught.  But he did.  Kind of, I don't think HE got caught personally.  Rather, the FBI showed up a few hours later and started a menial investigation... nothing was seriously damaged or stolen or whatnot, so they weren't too interested.  But the government finally realised that this congregation of high-IQ students was a "threat to national security." 
Ever since, the email accounts given to TAMS students from the University are monitored for key words (I actually tried this... I sent an email to myself, just for a control <you always need a control in experiments> and then another containing a few choice words... the first I received, the second never went though... no error message from mail-dÃ¦mons, etc.).  To this day, I know of a few people who are monitored even with their non-UNT accounts.
 
#### 15. This Spud's for You
There's apparently this thing called a 'zip' gun.  I never really understood the concept fully... something about a zip gun being a gun with a cylindrical barrel or something (something which somewho excluded a projectile launcher with a square barrel).  The definition was stupid.  And so was this incident.
At TAMS, JETS (Junior Engineering and Technical Society) is a big club.   They did all kinds of "real world" and "practical" experiments, one of which involved seeing how aerosol pressurization and ignition forces blah blah blah... with a potato gun.  The went to some field somewhere and did their tests.   No problem.  Until they came back to the dorm and left the potato gun in the president's car half under a jacket.
A patrolling university cop saw the offending object and busted out the window on probable cause... he thought it was a pipe bomb.  I don't know why...   and I certainly don't know why he went ahead and broke the window but hey... TAMSters are smart, the UNT cops aren't.  Spiel happened, and they still justified their actions by saying that 'zip' guns are illegal on campus.  Covering their asses.
Well, the pres and vp of JETS got out of any legal and academic trouble caused by possession of an illegal firearm by coming to our weekly seminar (my class had to go "listen" <ok, so we just pretended to listen> to the administrators tell us how to survive in the "real" world) and preach to us about why what they did was wrong (funny considering they couldn't see what was wrong about anything they did and neither did any of us).  But hey, the admin were appeased, and that's what most of our existence of TAMS was... making the admin thinkthey got their way.
 
#### 16. AERIS DIES???
Final Fantasy VII hit TAMS pretty hard, and it was immediately very popular.  Now you see there's this character called Aeris in it who likewise became very popular among my friends.  During the course of the plotline though, Sephiroth sweeps down and kills Aeris, yadda yadda yadda she dies.
Well this didn't go over too well with my friends.  One, when he was playing, got into an absolutely pissy/withdrawn mood when he reached that point.   Another hadn't gotten quite that far when we started discussing the philosophical and sociological impact of FF7 on a MUD we were developing.  We were talking nonchalantly about this and that and casually mentioned Aeris' fate... about 5 minutes after which he looked up from the keyboard (we were in the same room) and asked nonconnectedly "Aeris dies?".  He then proceeded to shout over the MUD "AERIS DIES?!"  Men and their fascinations...
 
#### 17. Attaaaaack of the Brainless Dipplefarks!
OK so that title is just kinda silly, but I'm not thinking as crooked as I normally do, so just bear with me (or bare with me if you'd prefer).
One of the coolest RA's we had decided to do something silly and get married and go into the military *boggle*.  This is  the guy that instead of punishing the students for making a general ruckus, he aided them in their endeavour â once, in the computer lab in Story #3, another RA came in and gave the students playing Command & Conquer to be a bit more quieter (heh), something about being able to hear them on the other end of the building at 2 in the AM or something silly like that and told one of the occupants: "And tell your RA to be quite or I'm going to doc him!" (doc stands for document, i.e. make a formal complaint and request for repremandation) and the RA playing C&Cjust kinda waved at her.  Also, remember the bit about no sex?  Well, once he noted that the only reason he would doc one particular individual would be if said individual were nekkid, avidly screwing a member of the opposite sex, yadda yadda yadda â essentially breaking every rule in the book relating to PDA â and then he would come in, applaud, and THEN doc him...
Well, anyways, where was I.  Oh.  Well, he left, and they   had to hire a new RA.  The guy the picked was some kind of degenerate or something I swear... he was beyond white trash tye person.  I still haven't figured out how the hell the admin decided he would be a good role-model (which is part of the job of the RA's) to us.  He was just a general nuisance.  At one point like a week after he moved in, in order to apologise for doing something stupid, he brought one of my friends a beer so they could become buds or something (BTW, if I recall properly, alcohol was prohibited on campus, even in dorms of people over 21 and also in frathouses).   Funny... the next day he was trying to get some of us to help him move out... needless to say we just continued our AD&D session...
 

 
Um... that's all the stories I have at the moment.  Well at least the more legal ones.  Maybe I'll add some more if I can remember them, or if my friends who are currently in Hell tell me any more.  And the not so legal ones... I think I'll wait until after the statute of limitations nullifies them...
